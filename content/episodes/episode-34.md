This week on Geeks in Progress: Matt tells a story, Kurt tells a joke, Chris steals a bit from John Mulaney, The Division launches its closed beta, Steam begins its Lunar New Year sale, and a Kickstarter team blows its budget on hookers and drugs; we discuss the state of early access games, and the games we've played during the podcast's hiatus.
